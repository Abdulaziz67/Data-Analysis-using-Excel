This Excel sheet contains a big data of 25977 Rows.
I have separated the data into two data sheets so I can use them clearly.
I named them 'customer details' and 'cutomer evaluation'.
I kept the ID column in both sheets so I can use it later for joining.
I used 'remove duplicate' but I found no duplicated data to be removed.
I added Filter to all colums so I can customize them later.
I replaced the class 'Eco' to 'Economy' using Substitue Fromula, fx =SUBSTITUTE(F2:F25977;"Eco";"Economy").
I changed 'Type of travel' formula to make both initial letters capital using fx =PROPER(E2:E25977).
I created two 'Pivot Tables' showing the 'travel class booked by gender' and 'customer loyality by travel class'.
I used 'Conditional Formatting' to distinguish the flights delays of over 15 minutes to be highlited in red.
I added new sheet called 'Charts' and made some related charts in it.
